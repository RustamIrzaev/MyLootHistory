My Loot History is a World of Warcraft addon that tracks everything you looted. Even copper coins.

➡️ Get the addon: [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/my-loot-history), [WoW Interface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info26672-MyLootHistory.html)

## What can be tracked

- every item you loot: weapons, junk, herbs and everything else
- every copper coin you loot

> It does not track quest rewards or similar.

## What I can do else

- see a big report!
- with a full list of everything you looted: items and even coins
- with an item icon, name and quantity
- with a date when you looted a particular item (or date range)
- open a chat and link an item you want
- with a little gold summary
- oh! And you can filter this report

## What? I can filter all those?

Yes! And history changes according to you filters. It will show you how much gold you looted and how many items you gathered depending on filters you selected. For example, if you looted 3xHochenblume yesterday and 1xHochenblume today, you will see the exact history.

- by date or date range:
  - Current Session
  - Today
  - Yesterday
  - Wednesday-to-Wednesday
  - This month
  - All the time
- by item quality
  - Poor
  - Common
  - Uncommon
  - Rare
  - Epic
  - Legendary
- by default, it filters as a 'item quality and upper'. But you can filter on 'Exact' item quality - there is a checkbox for that
- gold summary also updates according to date range you change

## What can be configured

- Show/hide minimap button
- Make the report window resizable
- Show looted date in the report
- Ignore items with 0 (zero) sell price
- Ignore quest items (note, this is a default state and it can't be changed)
- Show item ID in the report
- Show item tooltip on mouse hover in the report
- Show additional information in the tooltip (at the moment it adds a 'Total gathered' summary)
- Change icon size

## Some helpful additions

Besides, some additional features are available:

- print debug information
- reset everything (this will erase all looted information for items and gold)
- little FAQ
- small informative statistics (how many items were looted, how many total quantity is and in how many zones you looted them)

## Limitations

- The addon can't track items that were upgraded during the looting at the moment (for example, you got 302 il item and it was instantly upgraded to 323 il)
